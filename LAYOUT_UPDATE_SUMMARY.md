# Layout Save/Load Feature - Update Summary

## ✅ Changes Completed

The Save/Load Layout feature has been **completely redesigned** according to your requirements:

### 🎯 What Changed

   - ✅ Now saves as **PNG image** instead of JSON
   - ✅ Captures full view: video background + all objects
   - ✅ High-quality lossless PNG format
   - ✅ Auto-saves to Downloads folder or your chosen location

2. **Load Background** (formerly "Load Layout")
   - ✅ Now accepts **PNG or JPG images** instead of JSON
   - ✅ Loaded image becomes **static background**
   - ✅ Background is **locked** - cannot be moved or edited
   - ✅ You can **add, move, resize, and delete** new objects on top

3. **UI Updates**
   - ✅ Button renamed: "💾 Save as Image"
   - ✅ Button renamed: "📂 Load Background"
   - ✅ Updated tooltips to explain the new behavior

## 🎬 How to Use

### Saving a Layout
1. Arrange objects on canvas
2. Click **☰ Menu** → **💾 Save as Image**
3. File downloads as `layout-TIMESTAMP.png`
4. Done! Your layout is saved as a PNG image

### Loading a Layout
